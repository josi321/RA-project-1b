Aloha webpage part 2


Part 2 of Aloha webpage with additions using javascript and jquery. A slider/caraousel was made with Owl carousel, and javascript was used to create "add to cart" button, as well as displaying cart quatntity. 

portrait views on mobile, tablet work well, however in landscape view, the pictures (banner and category section) are squished, and the header size is off.
